# historical

Pulls historical data down from Binance and saves to a csv file.

The code is from this gentelman here:
https://medium.com/swlh/retrieving-full-historical-data-for-every-cryptocurrency-on-binance-bitmex-using-the-python-apis-27b47fd8137f

Includes a docker build file, and you do not need to make an account on Binance for this to work.
